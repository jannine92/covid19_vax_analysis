# Analysis of Symptoms possibly associated with Covid-19 Vaccinations

In this project, I analyzed data from the "Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System" (VAERS) which contains information about adverse reactions possibly associated with the vaccinations against Covid-19.

## Overview of the Results

* only a very small subset of the persons who got a vaccination against Covid-19 reported symptoms that might be associated with the vaccination
* most persons in the dataset experienced lighter symptoms
* for hospitalized people the frequent symptoms do not differ very much from the overall frequent symptoms while persons who died experienced very severe symptoms
* persons who died were elderly and had more often a medical background compared to the complete dataset
* with a machine learning algorithm, it is possible to predict whether a person might have to be hospitalized with a certain accuracy which means that our data has a certain power in terms of information content
