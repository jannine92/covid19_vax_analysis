He describes the pain as a dull heaviness sensation and approximate 3/10 pain severity.  Chest discomfort was associated with a feeling of flushing that was quite transient but chest discomfort was persistent.  Patient immediately presented to the ED for further evaluation.  He denies experiencing any chest pain upon waking up this morning.  Does note that he did have a transient episode of epistaxis on his way to work for which he had to pull over and apply pressure to his nose but this subsequently subsided and he attributed this to dry air as he has experienced epistaxis in the past but with less severity previously.   In the ER, vital signs noted for BP 133/76, pulse ranging 91-114, respiratory rate 16-20, 96% on room air.  Initial laboratory parameters were completely normal including normal CBC, CMP, LFT, lipase, UA, and normal D-dimer.  Initial troponin was negative x1.  EKG with sinus tachycardia, heart rate of 115.  Noted Q waves inferiorly.  No acute ST or T wave changes appreciated.  Chest x-ray with mild increased density in the left lower lobe.  Given this, patient was tested for rapid Covid which was negative but PCR was positive for COVID.  CT of the chest noted for focal subsegmental groundglass infiltrate at the superior segment of the LLL, likely infectious versus inflammatory.  Also noted small nonspecific groundglass attenuation with focal septal thickening at the right upper lobe which could be infectious or inflammatory, bibasilar atelectasis.  Patient was treated with aspirin 324 mg in the ED.  Of note, patient actually just received the COVID-19 vaccination on 12/24/20.  He denies any shortness of breath, no cough, denies any nausea or vomiting, denies any change in taste or smell nor change in appetite.  Does note 1 single episode of loose stool but otherwise denies any diarrhea.  Does report that he had approximate 48 to 72-hour period of fatigue and soreness at the site of the left deltoid injection following the vaccination but otherwise no further symptoms.  It is also noted that he does have a positive family history of coronary artery disease as his dad had an MI at the age of 49.  Patient has never undergone a cardiac catheterization in the past but does report having a negative stress test at the age of 42.  He is being admitted under the hospitalist service for further management  Patient was initially admitted under observation for chest pain obs.  However patient's Covid test came back positive and patient also had dynamic EKG changes concerning for possible unstable angina.  Patient was treated with aspirin Plavix full-strength Lovenox along with beta-blocker and a cardiology consult.  Serial troponins were negative.  Echocardiogram revealed normal EF of 55 to 60% with no hemodynamically significant valvular disease.  Cardiology felt that patient likely has underlying coronary artery disease have recommended discharge home with aspirin and Plavix with outpatient stress testing given his positive Covid testing.  At the time of discharge patient denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.  Patient was borderline diabetic with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.1.  Patient was discharged home with Metformin along with glucometer, glucose strip, lancets.  Given patient's tachycardia patient's Metformin 25 mg twice daily was changed to Toprol 25 mg daily.

The pain continued to intensify throughout the day and night and was 10/10 on a pain scale. In addition, I began to lose my ability to lift my left arm or use it. It became so weak that I had to use my right hand/arm to pick up my left arm to move it. My left arm was 'hanging and drooping' and my left shoulder was very  noticeably lower then my right shoulder. I called my primary care and employee health. My primary care doctor advised me to take advil and go to urgent care if the pain persisted and worsened. I could not sleep at all that evening of 12/29/20 because the pain was so intense and I had to keep picking my left arm up with my right arm to keep re-adjusting to try and get comfortable. The next morning I went to an orthopedic urgent care where I was diagnosed with nerve damage from the shot and prescribed Methylprednisolone 4mg dosepack. The doctor who saw me explained that he could not assess the extent of the damage at this time because my nerves were so agitated and inflamed. He scheduled a follow up visit with me for Thursday, January 7th and stated he will then proceed with an MRI and further investigation to assess the extent of the nerve damage.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 28Dec2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 29-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 21Dec2020 at 05:30 at 0.3 mL single (first dose) for Covid. Medical history was reported as ""none"". Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received Flu vaccine in Oct2020 for immunization. The patient is an Occupational Therapist, and he called to report an adverse event that he experienced with the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. He received the vaccine last Monday, 21Dec2020 at 5:30AM before his shift at work, then 20 minutes later, he was having severe stroke like symptoms. He experienced severe left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in his left hand and foot, he had issues finding his words and he couldn't speak, and he had an oral motor impairment where his mouth was weak and not coordinated. The staff at the hospital did a neurological exam on him, and he failed, so he had to go to the emergency room (ER). The patient added that he was already in the hospital when this happened, and the ER doctors suspected that he had a CVA, and they gave him TPA to prevent any permanent brain damage and it worked. The patient then added that due to the shock of this whole event, from  everything that happened, it has weakened his heart. Reportedly, he is a healthy 29 year old man, with no preexisting conditions, and he works out, and he has no heart conditions, but he had to get a cardiology follow up a few days after he got the vaccine, because he started going in to Ventricular Tachycardia, which he had never had in his life. So, the doctors at the hospital went ahead and did an Echocardiogram and an EKG, and he was told that his Ejection Fraction is down to 25%. He stated his heart is so weak, that he cannot work right now, but the structure of his heart is fine and has not had any damage. The hospital staff thought that maybe the patient had a chronic heart issue that he just did not know about, and that the stress of this event maybe made it kick into overdrive, but he states that the cardiologist said that was not the case, because the structure of his heart is fine, and the only thing they can see is that the heart is pumping weak. One physician even suggested that due to the shock of the event, he might have Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, which is a broken heart, but because the structure of his heart is okay, it should be reversible. He stated that he is hoping he will heal up good, because he is young and has no pre-existing conditions. He added that his heart is in such a state right now; he has to wear an external defibrillator. The patient stated that all these happened about 20 minutes after he received the vaccine, and he was admitted to the hospital from 21Dec2020 to 25Dec2020. His neurological symptoms have resolved except that he has a stutter that he did not have before and his mouth is fatigued easily, so he has to slow down when he is eating, but now he can eat regular for the most part. The patient confirmed that he was not specifically prescribed the product; it was administered to him at his place of work, but it was optional. He stated he considered how he is working with COVID patients every day, and given the circumstance, he thought that it would be a best practice for him to get the vaccine. He had not gone to his primary care doctor in a while because he had been fine and healthy, but he called them and found out that his primary care had retired, so he has to find a new one now. Regarding the issues finding words and trouble speaking, he stated that he has improved, but it is still ongoing, he is just stuck in a plateau zone. With the Ventricular Tachycardia, he stated that this is an ongoing issue, as he has to wear the life vest even though he has no need to activate it yet. He did have one minor bought of the VTach, but because he is a therapist, he knows how to take care of it with relaxation techniques, he knows how to manage it. He had one bought of VTach the evening prior, but he was able to get it under control. The doctors have him on medication to help keep his heart rate at bay. He has never had to use medication before and is on the following medications to help keep his heart rate at bay: Metoprolol 25mg one tablet once daily by mouth and Lisinopril 5mg one tablet once daily by mouth. The VTach has improved, it was good enough he was able to discharge home, but it is still a concern. His cardiologist said that, basically his hope, is that once his body recover from the whole shock of everything, then his ejection fraction will heal, and his heart will heal. He again stated that the doctor told him that the structure of his heart is perfectly fine; he has thick walls in his heart, no leaking valves, and the heart was not conducting any abnormal signals. The doctor just said that right now, his heart is super weak and that it is an acute problem. With the Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, he states that two doctors mentioned this diagnosis, but he confirmed that he was not actually diagnosed with this issue, he was just diagnosed with Ventricular Tachycardia. The outcome of the ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown to the patient at this time as he has not had another EKG or echocardiogram, but the cardiologist told him that the cardiologist expects that this will not be resolved quickly anyway. The patient confirmed that he did not receive any other vaccines on the same day he received the COVID vaccine. The only other vaccine he had this year was the flu vaccine which he got back in Oct2020. He has gone on to his online portal and there are the bloodwork results and all the imaging results on there from his CTs and MRIs, but he did not see the EKG or Echocardiogram results yet. He does not have this pulled up at this time, but he does have access to this stuff and can provide it later, if requested. He is curious about the next steps from here to how his case is processed. He is also curious if this information would help Pfizer make modifications to the vaccine if it is found that a lot of people are having the same reaction as he did. He is also wondering, given his situation, that probably he is not going to get the second dose, for his safety, but he is wondering what percentage of effectiveness the first dose does having just covered. The events left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in left hand and foot resolved on 25Dec2020; severe stroke like symptoms and oral motor impairment; mouth weakness and not coordinated/mouth is fatigued easily resolved in 2020.

Consequently, the patient got to the emergency room (ER) and then she was hospitalized due to the event of anticonvulsant drug level increased. It was reported that she was repeating the same people's names over and over (repetitive speech) and she was moving around a little (restlessness). A nurse and a friend helped to calmed down her.

She explained that the difference between phenobarbital and lamotrigine (LAMICTAL) when they went up was that with phenobarbital she would get delusion and made up delusions in her head and she could remember everything; in contrast, with lamotrigine (LAMICTAL) she could not remember much (amnesia).

A 50-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL1284, expiration date: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration at right deltoid on 29Dec2020 17:45 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma from 2003 and ongoing, tachycardia and major surgery. Concomitant medication included maintenance inhaler (unspecified) for asthma. Patient was officially diagnosed with asthma in 2003. She said her asthma was controlled, and she takes a maintenance inhaler every day. She said she has been taking the same maintenance inhaler since she was first diagnosed with the asthma. She said she rarely uses a rescue inhaler. Reported she was prescribed the Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg for her tachycardia that she had after her major surgery, but she did not take the full 25mg dose during that time. She said she hasn't had taken the Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg in almost a year, clarifying it was last Jan2020 that she used the Metoprolol Tartrate. The patient previously received a flu shot in Oct2020, and felt rundown for a day afterwards, but that she always does after she receives a flu shot. She said she had no heart issues after receiving the flu shot in Oct2020. The patient who is a registered nurse reported she received the COVID-19 vaccine last night at work, on 29Dec2020, at 5:45PM, and had experienced some tachycardia after receiving the vaccine. Reported the COVID-19 Vaccine was offered through her employer. She said the COVID-19 vaccine was optional and offered to all employees if they work at the hospital. She experienced the tachycardia at 11:00 PM last night, 29Dec2020. She said her normal resting heart rate is between the high 60s to low 70s. She said her heart rate at 11:00PM last night was at around 100, clarifying she was not running a fever at that time. She stated after she received the COVID-19 vaccine, she was not feeling right, so she took the day off from work today, and slept in. She said when she woke up this morning (in Dec2020), she still didn't feel right, saying she felt weak and wobbly, and when she checked her pulse it was 115. She said she does have a past history of tachycardia. She said a year ago she had major surgery, and she had tachycardia after the major surgery. She said the tachycardia eventually went away, but she did have to see a cardiologist and take a beta blocker. She said she took a tiny dose of the beta blocker this morning, and called the cardiologist to let him know what was going on. She said she has not heard back from the cardiologist yet. She said the tachycardia went away once she took the beta blocker this morning. She said she took the beta blocker because her heart rate was going higher, and higher. She said she didn't want to end up like last year after her major surgery with a heart rate in the 170s. She said the tachycardia she was experiencing after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine was not normal for her. She said once she got over the major surgery last year, her heart rate was fine. Reported her employer was making employees wait around for 15 minutes after the employees received the COVID-19 Vaccine to make sure no one had a major reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine, she waited around longer than the 15 minutes. She said she felt weird after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine and thought maybe she was experiencing anxiety. She said she was lightheaded on 29Dec2020 after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine and completed a report right then on the website. She said the website is for reporting adverse events, and she was sent a website link to complete the adverse event reporting. She said she signed into the website link while she was still at the hospital. She said one of the website's first questions asked was how she was feeling. She said the question made her wonder if her lightheadedness was due to her heart rate being up because she becomes lightheaded when that happens. She clarified she reported only the lightheadedness on the website, and not the tachycardia. She said her lightheadedness got better and she was fine, and then at 11:00PM the tachycardia hit her like a switch. Reported this morning she felt fine, and then all of sudden she wasn't fine. Tachycardia Treatment: Reported she took a 8.5mg dose, or one quarter of a 25mg tablet (as provided by the reporter) of the beta blocker Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg tablet this morning and called her cardiologist to let him know. She said she split the Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg tablet this morning, and only took a quarter of the 25mg tablet (reported as a 8.5mg dose by the reporter). Reported she believes 100% that her tachycardia was caused by the COVID-19 Vaccine, saying she has been fine up until receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she got the COVID-19 Vaccine because she was afraid of getting the COVID-19 Virus with her asthma. She said she has no other preexisting conditions besides the asthma. Reported she is not going to get the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said it was scary when her heart rate shot up out of nowhere. She said the COVID-19 Vaccine is the only thing different she has done. She said before the COVID-19 Vaccine, she was completely fine. Patient asked if the Pfizer DSU agent had heard of anyone else who has experienced tachycardia after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine.

The patient stated that on 30Dec2020 10:30, ""he became extremely lightheaded, like he was about to fall down. He sat down and is currently sitting down. This lightheadedness started about 20 minutes after the injection. When probed for the outcome, the caller explains it might be improving a little. The lightheadedness is not still not gone, but it has not worsened.  When probed for seriousness criteria, the caller explains he is just resting and sitting. He would say its not serious but it could be medically significant. He states he isn't sure if this is something that happens to just people who have had COVID before. He states none of his friends or relatives have this type of reaction. He lives in a retirement home and everybody is getting the injection. This is the second day of injections.

On 24 Dec 2020, minutes prior to the onset of the event, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for COVID-19 infection prophylaxis.  Within minutes, the patient felt dizzy and his heart was racing. His throat felt swollen and he experienced shortness of breath (""heavy breathing"") with no wheezing or stridor, but with chest tightness that he felt was possibly related to anxiety about receiving the vaccine and the potential for allergic reaction. No supplemental oxygen was required. Vital signs showed a heart rate of 145, with normal blood pressure (BP) and oxygen saturation. After a few more minutes, he started to feel numbness and tingling in his mouth and tongue. He experienced diaphoresis (""drenched in a cold sweat""), skin pallor (""skin was severely pale""), felt faint, and reported that his blood pressure was undetectable by a monitor. He did not lose consciousness and denied any skin rash. The patient felt he was developing an allergic reaction and self-administered his personal epinephrine auto-injector.

This patient was a healthcare worker (Doctor) in his 60's, weight within normal limits. The reported stated that obviously this person was exposed prior to getting the vaccine and was not symptomatic.

927821,01/08/2021,,,,,F,,"subjective myalgias; severe-symptomatic hypercalcemia; persistent flu-like symptoms; proteinuria; IgA-Kappa MM (multiple myeloma); Initial information received on 30-Dec-2020 regarding an unsolicited valid serious case issued from a literature article.   Discussion: Our case is unique in that the patient initially had anormal serum calcium level that had increased rapidly to over 22 mg/dl within a period of 24 hours, had no renal failure or any bone involvement; and had a normal quantitative serum light chain measurement. It is theorized that the inactivated influenza vaccine given prior to presentation unmasked an atypical presentation of MM (Multiple Myeloma). This may be attributed to a vaccination induced cytokine storm, especially IL-6 mediated (Interleukin), that may be the key in the pathophysiology of hypercalcemia related to MM (Multiple Myeloma).  This case involves a 65 years old female patient who had IgA (immunoglobulin)-kappa mm (multiple myeloma) (plasma cell myeloma), subjective myalgias (myalgia), severe-symptomatic hypercalcemia (hypercalcemia), persistent flu-like symptoms (influenza like illness) and proteinuria, after receiving vaccine INFLUENZA VACCINE.  Medical history, medical treatment(s), vaccination(s), concomitant medication(s) and family history were not provided.  On an unknown date, the patient received a dose of suspect INFLUENZA VACCINE produced by unknown manufacturer (lot number and expiration date not reported) via unknown route in unknown administration site for prophylactic vaccination.  On an unknown date, the patient had severe-symptomatic hypercalcemia (hypercalcemia, non-serious), within a period of 24 hours after vaccination.  On an unknown date, the patient presented with serious subjective myalgias (myalgia) 5 days following vaccination and was hospitalized for this event.  Vital signs were stable. CBC (complete blood count) and BMP (basic Metabolic Panel) were unremarkable.  Serum calcium was 10.8 mg/dl.   The patient was discharged on supportive therapy.   On an unknown date, patient presented a day later with persistent flu-like symptoms (influenza like illness, non-serious event, latency unknown).   Laboratory revealed serum calcium being above 22 mg/dl, normal renal function, total protein, albumin, ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) levels; clear UA (urine analysis) with no albuminuria; low PTH (parathyroid hormone) and 1, 25-(OH)2 (dihydroxy)-Vitamin D3 levels; elevated PTHrP (Parathyroid hormone-related protein) & viscosity levels.   On an unknown date, 24-hour urine collection of patient revealed non-serious proteinuria (550 mg), unknown latency following vaccination. Peripheral blood smear revealed rouleaux formation. CT (computerized tomography) scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed no obvious malignancy.   Quantitative immunoglobulins revealed elevated IgA (immunoglobulin A) (2415 mg/dl), and concurrent suppression of IgG (immunoglobulin G) and IgM (immunoglobulin M) levels. Quantitative serum light chain measurement revealed normal levels of kappa and lambda, with an elevated Kappa: Lambda ratio of 2:1.  On an unknown date, the patient's SPEP (serum protein electrophoresis ), UPEP (urine protein electrophoresis) and serum immunofixation test revealed serious IgA-Kappa MM (plasma cell myeloma, medically significant event, latency unknown).  Patient was treated with aggressive intravenous crystalloids, loop diuretics, calcitonin, pamidronate, and hemodialysis. Her calcium subsequently normalized to 10.1 mg/dl.   Bone-marrow biopsy revealed intracytoplasmic kappa-restricted monoclonal plasma cells that occupied 40% of the marrow. Bone survey was negative for lytic lesions.   Patient was started on bortezomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone and monthly zoledronic acid.  At the time of reports, the patient has not recovered from the event plasma cell myeloma, as it was reported that  she has not attained remission from myeloma yet.

A 71-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EH9899), intramuscular in left arm on 22Dec2020 11:08 at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included ongoing blood pressure high, ongoing cholesterol, ongoing depression. Concomitant medication included atenolol (tablet, strength 50 mg) from an unknown date and ongoing for blood pressure high, simvastatin (tablet, strength 20 mg) from an unknown date and ongoing for cholesterol, paroxetine hydrochloride (PAXIL, tablet, strength 40 mg) from an unknown date and ongoing for depression. The patient experienced hives, face swelling, itching and rash on 27Dec2020. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Prior vaccination within 4 weeks was none. She got the first Covid 19 dose on 22Dec2020 and was fine, then on 27Dec2020 she had hives, itching, and face swelling for several days. Caller stated her lungs were clear and she was okay other than the extreme itching. The face swelling was what worried her. The hives and itching went away within about 36 hours. The face swelling kind of got worse for a couple of days before it went away. Caller verifies she recovered from the hives/rash/itching within 36 hours. She got a steroid shot and things like that and it went away pretty quickly. The face swelling was completely gone but did last for a good 5 days. She didn't know if this reaction was related to the vaccine. She wanted to call and let Pfizer know and see if there was any reports of anything else like that or similar to that type of reaction. She was not sure if that really matters or not except she was not sure about taking the booster. She was kind of leaning towards taking the second vaccine. She didn't have any breathing issues. She asked as far as the second dose after those side affects, was it recommended? Her doctor said she could get the second one and prescribed her an Epi pen and would give a dose of Benadryl at the time of the second vaccine. She may take some Benadryl before getting the second vaccine and have her EpiPen with her just in case. She hadn't seen her doctor about this experience with the COVID-19 vaccine. She only went to an urgent care. The caller stated she went to urgent care twice. She received a steroid shot but doesn't have any name, NDC/UPC, Lot number or expiration date for any of the medication she received. She probably threw that paperwork out. She knew she wasn't given anything the second time she went to the urgent care. The second time she went back was because the face swelling was getting worse. She was prescribed an EpiPen and was told to take Zyrtec which did help. Everything had gone away. She would consider these events to be medically significant because of the face swelling, it kind of scared her. She made the comment she was taking high blood pressure medicine and cholesterol medicine, but other than that she was very healthy. She was not really an allergic person. She had not had any testing done since she received the vaccine. She did have bloodwork done prior but not since the vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood work prior vaccine with unknown result. The outcome of hives, rash and itching was recovered on an unspecified date of Dec2020 (within about 36 hours); face swelling was recovered on 01Jan2021.; Sender's Comments: Based on the time gap between the vaccine and the events there is not a reasonable possibility that the reported events were related to the suspect product,  events are most likely due to patient underlying contributory factors The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

By Wed 9/23 arm was not improving so called insurance advice nurse who said go to urgent care but declined to avoid unnecessary covid exposure. She said to wear arm sling and use Voltaren gel because I cannot tolerate NSAIDS. Following morning I had a virtual appointment with my primary care physician who said to minimize use of sling to avoid frozen shoulder, keep using Voltaren and ask physical therapist currently treating me for rehab post back surgery 6/2020 to add shoulder exercises, and let her know if still not better in 4 weeks at which time she would refer me to Physical Medicine specialist for nerve testing.

It improved significantly with addition of antipsychotics, worsened when antipsychotics were reduced, and improved again with addition of injectable antipsychotic on 12-10-2020.Patient suffered from falls on occasion given his significantly impaired physical mobility. His last documented fall was 8-31-2019. Patient began utilizing wheelchair most of time following that fall. No significant injuries noted in documentation of the falls. In the last 3 months, patient would often refuse medications. He would sometimes indicate that they would cause dizziness, and other times he would simply refuse. We attempted to hide medications in his food/fluid (with wife's blessing) and when he detected this he would occasionally refuse to eat. Patient previously on DOAC. After pharmacy review in 12/2020 it was recommended to discontinue this as no clear indication to continue use. He was high fall risk and would often refuse this medication as well since 10/2020. Noted to be in NSR on EKGs and decision made to discontinue the DOAC. Patient had no evidence of adverse effects noted after vaccination on December 28th. Patient seen by provider on the morning of his death (1/4/2021) with no noticeable significant change in health condition. Temperature 36.8Con January 4th at 19:45.

I did notice at the time, but could not fully see, that the injection appeared to be much higher on the shoulder than normal. I immediately came  home afterwards and relaxed. Approximately 2hrs later, I began experiencing extreme pain in my right shoulder. As the night progressed, the pain worsened to 10/10 with inability to move my arm. Later that night after requiring assistance to take off my shirt, I noticed that the bandaid overlying the injection site was very high, immediately below and bordering the acromion process. This was concerning but I was hopeful the pain would go away over the next few days. I took tylenol that night. I woke up multiple times during the night because the pain was so severe. When I woke up, the pain and inability to move my arm were still present. I began taking 800mg ibuprofen and 1000mg tylenol alternating Q4 throughout the next few days. The pain and disability remained so severe that I required assistance performing ADLs for  the next 4 days. On day four, with the pain not resolved and still severe despite consistent advil and tylenol use, I began having concern for shoulder injury related to vaccine administration. The next day I decided to seek an evaluation by an orthopedist. I am a physician and was unable to perform basic tasks and ADLs. I happened to have a few days off after the injection but would not have been able to work had I not.

Registered Nurse stated, ""I received vaccine this past Wednesday. I was just talking to a couple of my colleagues and honestly I received the vac. at work. I did not really read through the paperwork and was 'weird' sharing reactions to the vaccine which for me was pretty bad reaction and thought like I need to go through your paperwork and report it. So I thought I should call and just give some information. The usual fatigue which I go to after being normal, my arm was not sore. However, as the week progressed into Friday I had a constant headache but it was manageable and then by Friday night my glands swelled, my nerves behind my ears, my neck and I was extremely fatigued, bad headache and went to bed and I had not gone out and finally I got out today I spoke with my Physician yesterday.

But we think that it is a family thing. No treatment for the Lyme. I did a lot of antibiotic and a lot of naturopathic stuff but that is in the past. But anyhow for anything else what I did was when I got the injection they said try and just take Tylenol not Ibuprofen but there was no way I was going to make it through with just that . So I took Ibuprofen. I called my Physician yesterday morning because I was not sure about what was is happening and I thought it might be secondary sinus infection or something else going on and it reassured me that it is definitely due to the vaccine. He said it is just your body's reaction, take the Ibuprofen, hydrate. Had me take what I had in my house Tigan for nausea. So I was extremely nauseous from the severity of the headache.""

She received the Pfizer Covid vaccine on 18Dec2020. She was exposed to the virus through close personal contact right around this same time-frame and did develop the virus herself.  She wanted to know if there were any recommendations regarding her needing to get the second dose in series.  She stated that her husband, who was not vaccinated, had the virus and developed more serious symptoms than she did.  She is concerned about worsening side effects with the second dose and stated that she felt like crap the night after her first dose with chills and arm pain. The patient tested positive for COVID-19 on 26Dec2020. Specific test name was unknown, but she knows it was not a rapid test. She is scheduled to get the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 08Jan2021. She called to ask if she should or should not get the second dose relative to the COVID-19 diagnosis. She has not been able to find the information she is asking about. The outcome of the event of Covid-19 was recovering while other events was unknown. The Covid-19 was assessed as unrelated to the suspect drug.; Sender's Comments: No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.

On an unspecified date, the day later, the patient presented with persistent flu-like symptoms. Labs revealed serum calcium being above 22 mg/dl; normal renal function, total protein, albumin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels; clear urine analysis (UA) with no albuminuria; low parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 1, 25-(OH)2-Vitamin D3 levels; elevated parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and viscosity levels. 24-hour urine collection revealed proteinuria (550 mg). Peripheral blood smear revealed rouleaux formation. Computerized tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed no obvious malignancy. Quantitative immunoglobulins (Ig) revealed elevated IgA (2415 mg/dl), and concurrent suppression of IgG and IgM levels. Quantitative serum light chain measurement revealed normal levels of kappa and lambda, with an elevated Kappa: Lambda ratio of 2:1. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), urine protein electro-phoresis (UPEP) and serum immunofixation revealed IgA-Kappa MM. The patient developed severe-symptomatic hypercalcemia, she was treated with aggressive intravenous crystalloids, loop diuretics, calcitonin, Pamidronate (pamidronate disodium), and hemodialysis. The patient's calcium subsequently normalized to 10.1 mg/dl. Bone-marrow biopsy revealed intracytoplasmic kappa-restricted monoclonal plasma cells that occupied 40% of the marrow. Bone survey was negative for lytic lesions. The patient was started on bortezomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone and monthly zoledronic acid, and she has not attained remission from myeloma yet.  On an unknown date, the patient recovered from the event 'hypercalcemia'.  At the time of initial report, the patient had not recovered from 'multiple myeloma'.  The outcome of all the rest events was not reported.   The reporters assessed the event of 'cytokine storm' as related to the influenza virus vaccine polyvalent. It was theorized that the inactivated influenza vaccine given prior to presentation unmasked an atypical presentation of MM. This may be attributed to a vaccination induced cytokine storm, especially IL-6 mediated that may be the key in the pathophysiology of hypercalcemia related to MM. The reporter did not provide a causality assessment for other events.  The events of 'cytokine storm' and 'multiple myeloma' were considered to be medically significant by a Physician within Seqirus's Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department.    Company comment: A 65-year-old female patient experienced cytokine storm, plasma cell myeloma, hypercalcemia and influenza like illness. Symptoms of the reported events started emerging one day after administration of influenza virus vaccine polyvalent. Very detail laboratory and diagnostic findings were provided in the report. Causality is assessed as possibly related for influenza like illness and for cytokine storm due to biological plausibility and presented information and unrelated for plasma cell myeloma due to biological and temporal implausibility. Hypercalcemia is more likely related to myeloma however the reporter's rationale points to vaccine as well, therefore assessed as unlikely related.

Start date of constant ringing in right ear was 05Jan2021. The events resulted in Physician Office visit. Hearing loss in right ear worsened and constant ringing in right ear were reported serious as medically significant while the other events were reported as non-serious. She went to see an ENT doctor and get a hearing test. The hearing test showed moderate hearing loss and speech clarity of 96% in her left ear compared to 52% in the right ear.

He was given prednisone 20mg to take 3 times by mouth every day for 5 days, tetracycline 100mg, at 1 capsule by mouth twice a day for 10 days and methylprednisolone (SOLU MEDROL; Lot: 9945776;Exp: Nov2021) 4mg dose pack, started with 6 tablets first day. It was told by doctor it might cause tick problems. He was waiting for results. On 04Jan2021 went to family doctor and more blood work was taken. Because he was taking prednisone, noticed his sugar was up a little bit (date unspecified). It was prescribed Glitizide extended release, 2.5mg one tablet twice a day with breakfast. Patient was checking sugar every 6 hours. It was also prescribed Acyclovir 400mg one tablet orally five times per day for 10 days. 08Jan2021 is last day of prednisone 5 day dose and will follow up with methylprednisolone tablets.

Could not work with eyes tearing all of the time. Needed to be alert. When driving, had to focus on the right side because his left side will blur. He had to chew only on the right side because food will be left behind in between his cheeks and gums. If he drank through a straw, he had to cover the left side of his lips so he was able to suck out fluids. He thought symptoms were progressively getting worse, he didn't see much improvement. He clarified swelling was on lower part of mandible on left side. It was slightly bigger than right. When looking at face, the lines on his forehead on the left side were down. If he smiled he cannot raise his left eye brow, when before the COVID-19 vaccine he could. Noticed left side of nose was lower than the right. Cannot raise left side of lips.

Triage nurse advised that dad follow up with PCP office when open in the AM.  Dad called our office at 10:25am on 12/21/2020 stating that pt fever had lifted, but pt vomited a total of 5 times since the night before, with the last episode at 7:45 am on 12/21/2020. Pt had adequate fluid intake and urine output and stool had softened. MA advised continued home care. Appropriate triage advice was given and documented. At 16:43(pm) on 12/21/20, dad called back to clinic stating patient symptoms had worsened and they were at the emergency department. Dad disconnected call before speaking with the MA. The MA attempted to call dad back, but there was no answer. A message was left for dad to return call. On 12/22/20 at 12:44(pm), dad called in to clinic to report that pt had died- cause unknown. Our clinic obtained records from Hospital. The ED report stated that pt presented to the emergency department via EMS Code 3 in cardiac arrest. Unknown downtime prior to the initiation of chest compressions. Pt was staying with grandparents. When grandma went to wake pt from his nap, he was not responsive. When grandma tried to pick him up, there was possibly some brief, generalized seizure activity as well as coughing and gagging. Child remained unresponsive and was taken by private vehicle to outside Urgent Care where pt was found to be apneic and in asystole. An AED was applied, no shock advised. EMS was called and CPR was started. EMS placed an endotracheal tube and established IO access. 4 rounds of epinephrine were administered during the course of the prehospital resuscitation which was approximately 15-20 minutes. Presenting rhythm was asystole. No change in rhythm upon transport and arrival. Immediately upon arrival the pediatric transport team was activated and the pediatric intensivist was paged. Chest compressions were resumed according to protocol. Additional inter osseous access was established in the left proximal tibia. Fluid bolus was initiated. Serial doses of epinephrine were administered every 4 minutes throughout the resuscitation. The child also received several boluses of IV bicarb. Online consultation by ED physician with PICU attending was established early in the resuscitation course. It was agreed by ED physician and PICU attending that the peds transport team would be dispatched urgently to the ED location in anticipation of possible ROSC and need for emergent transport to PICU. It was agreed by ED physician and PICU attending that transportation would not be initiated with the child still undergoing resuscitation requiring chest compressions prior to ROSC. Initially, endotracheal tube position felt to be acceptable based on the clinical evaluation, however chest x-ray did demonstrate some degree of right mainstem intubation, after which the tube was pulled back approx 2cm and subsequent x-ray showed the ETT tip in good position approx 1 cm above the carina.  Initial end-tidal CO2 was 14 on arrival, this continued to trend downward until undetectable throughout the course of the resuscitation. At no point were there palpable pulses or other evidence of return of circulation throughout the resuscitation. Capillary blood glucose was initially undetectable. The child received serial boluses of D 25 via IO line for a tital of 30 g dextrose after which CBG ultimately came up to 244. Multiple efforts were made throughout the resuscitation to achieve IV access and to obtain blood for laboratory studies. All efforts were unsuccessful, making it impossible to obtain any labs throughout the course of the resuscitation. Attempts to obtain even capillary blood samples via heel stick for CBG measurements were extremely difficult. Resuscitation continued for 49 minutes after ED arrival. A total of at least 65 minutes of CPR time. Bedside ultrasound was used to look for cardiac activity during the last 5 pulse checks of the resuscitation, demonstrating cardiac standstill. Despite the efforts and interventions mentioned, ROSC was never obtained and the code was discontinued at 17:03(pm). The child's parents were informed of his death upon their arrival to the ED at approximately 17:40(pm). Family was given time with the pt. The medical examiner arrived and discussed case at 19:11(pm). At 19:49(pm) Medical Examiner was interviewing grandparents along with 2 County Detectives.

A 53-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on right deltoid on 05Jan2021 07:45 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Family history included migraine (other family members). Medical history included mild blood pressure and kidney stones, reactive airway disease. Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), potassium, allopurinol and hydrochlorothiazide/valsartan for mild blood pressure and kidney stones, fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) for reactive airway disease, atorvastatin, and multivitamins. The patient previously took fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) and experienced dry mouth and lost sense of taste. The patient also previously took Tdap booster on Aug2020, Shingrix on 10Aug2020, and influenza on 12Oct2020; all for immunization; and tetanus injections for immunization and experienced localized tenderness. The patient had the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EH9899) for COVID-19 immunization on 15Dec2020 and experienced localized tenderness at injection point. The received his second dose of COVID vaccine on 05Jan2021. With the first dose he had increased localized tenderness at injection site on 15Dec2020, and he rated it mild to moderate. He would say it was 80% resolved in 24 hours. It had completely resolved in 36 hours. He would say that he has recovered completely form the localized tenderness with the first dose. Then he noted his second dose was yesterday, in the context of not having much sleep the night before. The actual injection was uncommonly eerily painless. The other folks in his department had similar experience. Maybe it was the nurse who gave the injection. Maybe it was because it was the same area and sensitivity was decreased. They had to check the Band-Aid to make sure blood was there. The administration was painless. He was relieved when the arm started getting sore to know he actually received it. He had increased arm tenderness at injection site which he rated as moderate which has now resolved. It got to moderate where lifting the arm up was sore. He definitely knew that he had been vaccinated. He got the vaccine at 7:45AM and now it is 16 to 17 hours later and he would say the pain is mild now. It did persist. The first vaccine hurt a little more. He expects this to go away. Ten hours after injection he had shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias. He had unrelenting headache over night that was moderate to severe. He said it kept him awake. It was exacerbated by lying down. Sitting up helped him. It became a migraine which is something he doesn't often experience. Migraines are pretty rare for him. He took 800mg of Advil at 6AM that helped for headache and migraine. The weight of the patient was 250 to 255 pounds. Shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias have resolved. Everything has resolved except for a little headache. In the background he literally had one or two hours of sleep. He thinks that likely precipitated a migraine was increased. Last night he slept literally an hour. He took 800mg of Advil and fell asleep. He is operating on 2 hours of sleep in 48 hours. Most of the stuff is gone except a little headache and expected fatigue. Headache Seriousness Criteria: he would say that it was relatively disabling. He would not have been able to carry on. He wouldn't have been able to operate last night. It would have interfered. It was dissimilar to others. He gets rare migraines. Everything was amplified with a migraine. He certainly felt that. It was fair to say the vaccine precipitated the migraine that was mild or severe. He doesn't want to falsely attribute these things to the vaccine. Causality Headache: precipitated by the vaccine. In the context that he had not slept the night before. He had a nasopharyngeal COVID test and it was negative. He has been in a COVID study where they are looking at combination. They developed a saliva test at (Name). There is a combination of saliva oropharyngeal and immunoglobins. He has been negative multiple times.

She went back up to where they were giving vaccines, they took her temperature and it was 100. It had been normal the morning before she got the vaccine. Her heart rate was elevated at 100. They put a blanket on her and said they wanted to watch her for 15 minutes. In that time her fever went to 101 and her heart rate was 110. They took her to the ER. She was there for 5 hours. Her heart rate went to the high 120s. They did a 12 lead EKG. Her temperature had gone to 102.6, which was the highest. They gave her a liter of Normal Saline.

The hospital said that for this next dose, they would give her the injection, wait 15 minutes, then send her home, expecting that she would have the same thing happen.

Her 2nd dose is due on 10Jan2020 and she wanted information on the use of antibody therapy with the Covid-19 vaccine. She asked if she should still get the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine as scheduled on 10Jan2021 relative to these events. She reported she still has COVID symptoms which have improved, but the symptoms she can't taste or smell are ongoing and persistent. Seriousness criteria: she thought it was serious but she was not injured or anything with it; she thought event was offset it by taking some medication and the Bamlanivimab infusion. In addition to Bamlanivimab infusion for treatment of the COVID virus she was also prescribed Azithromycin for 5 days started on 29Dec2020 which she completed; and Prednisone for 7 days started on 29Dec2020 which she stopped after 5 days of therapy because she did not like how it made her feel. The outcome of the event was recovering. Event relatedness between Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and COVID virus was unrelated.; Sender's Comments: Based on the information currently available, lack of efficacy of the suspected vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be completely excluded. However, individuals may not be protected until at least 7 days after their second dose of the vaccine. It is unlikely that the patient would have fully developed immunity due to the very short time lag between the first vaccine dose and the event onset.",,,,,,,,,N,12/20/2020,12/28/2020,8,Test Date: 20201229; Test Name: COVID nasal swab test; Test Result: Positive,UNK,,,,Medical History/Concurrent Conditions: Asthma (Caller states she has asthma and diabetes.); Diabetes (Caller states she has asthma and diabetes.),,USPFIZER INC2021013477,2,01/13/2021,,,,

I began to see black and chest pain was severe feeling like i was having a heart atack and was going to pass out so i called 911.

Arrived around 0130. My heart rate sustained at 140s in the ER so I was admitted at 0530 am. My D Dimer was a bit elevated as well as my lactic so I was given a bolus of fluids plus maintenance. I had a CXR done, CTA chest(negative for PE), UA, Labs, entire cardiac workup including an ECHO during my admission. I also began to have loose stools and wrist joint pain. MY heart rate sustained at 125-147 for about 30 hours. Fevers on and off. After everthing was negative we determined this was secondary to the covid 19 vaccine. I was discharged 1/13/2021 at around 1:30 pm. My heart rate is still not at baseline which is 87-90. I'm 100-130 and still get very fatigued with a simple slow walking. Still having tachycardia, fevers, body aches, joint wrist pain, chest discomfort and headaches. My potassium was 3.0 at discharge so will be needing labs in a week.

No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  This 69-year-old female had medical history of ongoing essential tremor started in her 50's.  The reported anterior cervical fusion was most likely due to concurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the vaccine of BNT162B2.

My team consisted of (technician), (nurse) and I. As we were setting up, the director asked how she can help. I explained to her that we would need a designated area for patients to be monitored after vaccination for 15 minutes and maybe even longer . I also explained that we would need one of her staff monitoring while we vaccinate. She agreed, and proceeded to designate her staff and the cafeteria area, facing the vaccination station,the monitoring station.   Throughout the day, nurse and I were both vaccinating,while the staff of the facility would monitor the vaccinated patients. I would also stop occasionally to mix the vaccine and check the temperature of the aero safe.   At approximately 12:50pm, the director rushed in and stated that a patient is not responding, and that she had been vaccinated. At that point, I grabbed epipens and a thermometer and I also instructed nurse to grab an Epipen and come with me. We followed the director to pt's room. Once we got to the room, the patient was in bed and there were 4 staff members standing bedside and one of them turned and stated the patient has passed. At that point I asked the staff how long ago did the patient get the vaccine, they stated about 30 minutes ago. They also stated that the patient was a hospice patient and that the patient had declined, and was rapidly detiorating and had not eaten or drank anything all day . They also stated that the patient had been monitored for 15 minutes post vaccination. I then left the room and grabbed the patients COVID Vaccine intake consent form.     I looked at the answered questionaire and all the responses were circled NO. Patient had a temp of 96.5 at the time of vaccination.The vaccine administration information for Immunizer Section was filled out by Nurse. I then proceeded to ask the director once again if there were staff that was monitoring her for 15 minutes, the director stated they had staff monitoring her. She also stated the Hospice nurse has to announce her death, so they waited for the Hospice Nurse to come.  I then called Corporate and explained the situation. After speaking to corporate, I also asked nurse, if she remembered the patient. She stated that she did and at the time of the vaccination the patient was not alert, there were two staff members with the patient. She was non oriented and she kept closing her eyes. At that point, Nurse stated that she asked the two staff members with her if this is how she usually is and if its ok to vaccinate her. Both Staff members stated that it its ok,this is how she is. The Nurse then proceeded to vaccinate.  At approximately 3:10pm, as I was leaving I spoke to the director, and one of her Staff members. Staff that the patient has actually not eaten/ or drank anything for the past several days, including today(01/18/21). Staff also stated that on Friday, Jan 15th,2021, they had informed the family that the patient was rapidly detiorating. Staff also stated that the family knowingly gave the consent to vaccinate her.

She initially had increased cough from wearing mask and was having post nasal drip, then she got wet cough and that was when she decided to get tested. She went back and forth on dates; stated she was confused with the dates because of being in the hospital, it had been a while and the dates were all meshing in together. Her specimen was collected and they did the test on 29Dec2020 then found out that she tested positive for COVID virus with a COVID test nasal swab on 30Dec2020 17:30. She mentioned she lost weight after she got COVID, had no sense of taste or smell on unspecified dates. She did not know if it was related to her thyroid but she started losing hair and her heart rate started increasing on Monday, so they took her off all her meds and said the COVID was doing crazy things to the body. She had to go on Carvedilol for the sinus tachycardia and had high blood pressure now. This was all new after she tested positive. She has had bouts of tachycardia before and did have a heart monitor as she had a stroke last year. So those have never been persistent or symptomatic. If she did have a high heart rate, it always went down. This one was symptomatic. She did fine the whole week after the shot, just had that little bit of sleepiness, was tired, and had a headache. The patient reported near syncope with sinus tachycardia due to COVID-19 and hypothyroidism on 08Jan2021 14:30 to 15:00, which required hospitalization from 08Jan2021 to 10Jan2021 (2 days). ER or physician's office was required. She never went to the ER for the vaccination, it was just for the near syncope with sinus tachycardia due to COVID-19 and hypothyroidism that she went and was then admitted to hospital. She just got out of the hospital the day before report (10Jan2021), was there for two days and was still recovering. She was supposed to receive her second vaccination on the day of report however her doctor did not know if she should get the second dose due to double antibodies. She did not ask if she still had the virus or it went away. She has not been to work in two weeks.

This 52-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in left arm, on 07Jan2021, for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) from 1998 and vitiligo from 1988. She was overweight. She had really no other risk factors. Concomitant medications were not reported. On 08Jan2021 the patient experienced heart attack and she had a MI, then a cardiac catherization that was normal and a normal echo as well. She said it was diagnosed as a NSTEMI and not a large MI, the smaller version. These events required hospitalization from 08Jan2021 to 12Jan2021. MI occurred after she finished clinic and she was not standing or doing anything, just sitting and she had chest pain. Her office was right next to the ER, so she received treatment within an hour and they were able to help her. She said that her hospital couldn't do a cardiac cath, so on 11Jan2021 they moved her to an hospital which was another treatment facility. When she had her MI they gave her acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) and sublingual nitroglycerin. They tested her troponin and did an EKG which was abnormal on an unspecified date in Jan2021. On 08Jan2021 troponin was increased. When they treated her with nitroglycerin and Aspirin, two hours later her EKG was normal and her troponin came down overnight on 09Jan2021, which was when they said for sure that she had a heart attack. The patient said it was very scary to have a heart attack, but thankfully there was not a lot of damage done and she was able to get treatment quickly. She did not think the event was disabling since they did not see much damage to her heart muscle, it was a near miss kind of thing. She said it was life changing in that she will now be on medication forever, she will be on at least a baby Aspirin and probably something like a statin for the rest of her life. She was recovering, it was unknown what the lasting effects may be, she felt normal but tired from her hospital stay. Heart attack resolved on 08Jan2021.

The subject is in open-label phase of the study when the event occurred.  A 27-year-old female with a medical history of seasonal allergies (Mar2006 and ongoing not taking any medications to treat) who received the first dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO) (dose 1) on 14Aug2020 at 10:34, second dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO) (dose 2) on 04Sep2020 at 09:27.

All intramuscularly in the left deltoid as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Concomitant medications included ethinyl-estradiol/norethisterone acetate (LOESTRIN) for birth control from May2014 and ongoing. There was no family medical history relevant to AE and no concomitant vaccine administered on the same date of investigational vaccine or other prior vaccine within four weeks.  The subject experienced neuropraxia of left arm on 11Jan2021 at 09:51 considered an important medical event requiring a visit to physician office.  The clinical course was the following: At 9:51, 3 minutes after receiving the second dose of BNT162B2 in left deltoid, the subject complained of left arm numbness and tingling starting at elbow and extending to fingers, weakness, and a weak grip in that hand. She also reported a decreased range of motion on the left side including her arm, shoulder joint, elbow, wrist, and metacarpophalangeal. Subject was afebrile with a normal vascular exam, no bruising, capillary refill time was less than 3 seconds. No antipyretic medication was administered. The investigator requested the subject to return to site the following day. On 12Jan2021, the investigator noted some improvement to symptoms but the subject was unable to return to work for several days after event. An appointment was scheduled with a neurologist for 13Jan2021. The action taken with BNT162B2 for the event was not applicable. The clinical outcome of the event was recovering.   The investigator considered there was a reasonable possibility that the event neuropraxia of left arm was related to the second dose of BNT162B2 (dose 4) and clinical trial procedure (vaccination administration in the left deltoid, investigator did consider the location was appropriate), but unrelated to first and second dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO), first dose of BNT162B2 (dose 3) or concomitant medications. Per investigator, it was not likely that the event was related to the investigational product (IP) itself, however, that could not be 100% determined until neurologist had evaluated the subject.; Sender's Comments: The event ""Nerve Injury"" is unlisted in the Single Reference Safety Document (SRSD) of the Investigational Product therapy vaccine (BNT162B2).  There is a reasonable possibility for the event ""Nerve Injury"" to be related to the procedure of vaccine (BNT162B2) administration (needle trauma) rather than to the product administered. The event would not be considered a unique response to this specific vaccine (BNT162B2). The case will be reassessed upon reception of neurological advice.

This 58-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot # EI0142, expiry date Mar2021), intramuscular once to the left deltoid, on 28Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 58-years-old. Medical history was none. Concomitant medications included an antihypertensive medication taking for several years. On 28Dec2020 the patient experienced side effects including sore deltoid (lasted for 2 days, Dec2020), and on 01Jan2021 the patient experienced upper bicep pain which he felt 5 days later (his friend said it may be lymphadenopathy).  The caller had the COVID vaccine on 28Dec2020, and from 28Dec2020 he had a sore deltoid for a couple days, but then almost a week later developed, he thought it was tendonitis, it was the upper part of his bicep, really he could not extend his arm all the way, it was so painful in that area, and it's still somewhat painful, but better. The sore deltoid was pretty much after the shot and into the next 48 hours, that went away, then he noticed this soreness around the upper part of his bicep, not until, probably, maybe 5 days later, on 01Jan2021. He was chatting with someone, who mentioned soreness in the underarm area, that person felt it was lymph nodes, so maybe, there is possibility, caller thought this was muscle pain, as it hurts when he tried to extend his arm, it does not hurt when sitting here, but when he extends, especially over his head, it is really quite painful but it's lessened, he thought it was a tendonitis, but it could be the lymph nodes active or enlarged, he is not sure, he has never noticed lymph node pain, so he never knew what it was.  Causality for soreness around upper part of bicep was reported as yes. He is pretty sure, since he has not done anything that aggravated that muscle, he can't think of anything, and it is in the general vicinity of the injection. States he is on an antihypertensive medication, but has been taking it for several years. He doesn't want to go through a report for the person he spoke to, who mentioned soreness in the underarm area, but it is interesting: the caller told him that had soreness, caller knows he also did report it, he reported it to Pfizer, actually he doesn't know if it was Pfizer or Moderna, but he reported it to whichever company, and said he thought was inflamed lymph nodes, so that was the first time he thought it was not muscle, but maybe the lymph node's reaction to vaccine, he has never experienced this kind of discomfort, he could not straighten his arm, as he would straighten the pain was at the upper insertion at the bicep, so that is where he came to this conclusion, his preliminary conclusions, he never thought it would persist this long. He thought, as time went by, it would be better tomorrow, and it has gotten better, but has not gone away.  Sore deltoid was reported as non-serious while soreness around upper part of bicep was reported as serious medically significant because it has persisted for so long, he would have not expected it to keep going on, but it is almost going on two weeks. Outcome of the event soreness around upper part of bicep, lymphadenopathy, and tendonitis was not recovered while the outcome of the sore deltoid was recovered in Dec2020.

The patient's medical history, as provided by the reporter, included diabetes, hypertension, Hashimoto's, smoker, cataracts, atrioventricular block, occasional premature ventricular contractions, and hypertriglyceridemia. Concomitant medications reported included metformin, glimepiride, lisinopril, atorvastatin, aspirin, methimazole, propranolol, and cilostazol.   On 05 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 037k20a) for COVID-19 infection prophylaxis.

Early in the morning on 29Dec2020, around 3:30 a.m., she woke up and had a racing/pounding feeling in her chest. She took her blood pressure and it was 158/86, heart rate (HR) was 83. She felt really funny. She hadn't been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, so this was high for her. She took her blood pressure again about an hour later and it was 165/95, HR 73. She took it again about an hour later and her blood pressure read 180/98, HR 77. Her heart rate stayed in the normal range, but the force felt really strong. She did go to the emergency room around 5:00 am on 29Dec2020. She told them what she was experiencing and that she had received the COVID-19 vaccine. About the time she got to the hospital, her blood pressure was starting to come down. An EKG was done and they drew bloodwork. Her potassium came back a little low-they didn't tell her how low or what her level was. She was given 2 potassium tablets which did help. She confirms she doesn't have any NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the potassium she was given. It was given to her at the hospital. She was also given a sheet to monitor her salt intake, which she already does that. She confirmed she was not admitted into the hospital, she was discharged from the Emergency Room. She felt pretty good. She didn't go to work that Wednesday, 30Dec2020, but she went to work on Thursday, 31Dec2020. On 01Jan2021, the same thing happened to her again. She had elevated blood pressure, forceful beat. She went back to the ER early in the morning, around 5:00 am, on 01Jan2021. Her pulse stayed within normal range, but she had such a forceful beat. She informed them that she was really uncomfortable in her chest, the force was the most uncomfortable at this point. They wanted to make sure she wasn't have a stroke or heart attack, so they did their normal procedures to rule this out. They did 2 EKG's, 2 sets of labs, Chest X-ray, CAT scan and everything came back normal. She had a discussion with the physician that saw her about what she was experiencing and the physician was asking her about having anxiety. Caller explains she has never really had problems with anxiety before, but she can't say she hasn't had it. Being around COVID patients and getting the shot, sometimes anxiety can be there. The physician wanted her to try a low dose of Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg. She was to only to take a half dose by mouth, if her top number (systolic blood pressure) was between 140-160. Caller clarifies when she means half of a dose, the dose equals 12.5mg. She was instructed to take this 12.5mg dose until she saw her PCP. So, she did this and called her PCP and wasn't able to get an appointment to speak with a provider until the following Wednesday, 06Jan2021. She did a tele visit with her provider and let her know what had happened and that the half of the pill will only bring her top number (systolic blood pressure) to 130's-140's. Caller states she was used to her top number (systolic) being maybe in the 120's, low 130's. Her doctor increased her dose to 25mg. She was prescribed to take 25mg, tablet, by mouth, once a day. She confirmed she still checks her blood pressure before she takes the medicine. Caller verifies she has 2 bottles, one being the 12.5mg dose and the second being the 25mg dose. With the 12.5mg bottle, she sees refills and the date 05Jan2022. Caller clarifies both bottles are dispensed in pharmacy vials with no NDC, Lot number or expiry date. About a month prior to all of this and receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, clarified as Nov2020, she was treated for a UTI. During that time, her blood pressure went up a little and kind of bounced around a little bit, but came back down. Then, she got the COVID-19 shot. She initially felt fine but later on by the time she got a chance to do the tele visit with her PCP, she was telling her about her previous UTI, and the provider put her on Cipro because it seemed like her UTI symptoms were coming back. Caller verifies she doesn't have any NDC, Lot number or expiration for the Cipro. She already took of all of that. She went to the ER for the third time on 08Jan2021 because she again felt the forceful beat feeling in her chest. She explained she felt really wiped out and worn down and she was tired. An EKG was done and they did labs. She confirms she doesn't have any results with her at this time. She was taken off of work for a couple of weeks. She is currently getting in contact with a Cardiologist to make sure everything is alright. The cardiologist wants her to have a stress test. The caller states so this is where she is now. She is taking blood pressure medicine and getting set up to do a stress test. Sore arm outcome: Caller confirms she recovered from the arm soreness within that same day. Her arm didn't stay sore long at all. Racing/pounding in chest: This had improved. It's not like it was. She still has it a little bit of it now, but she is going to see her cardiologist and do a stress test. The blood pressure medicine has helped some. Elevated blood pressure: Today her blood pressure top number got to 161 and she had to take medication but her blood pressure has improved. Outcome of elevated blood pressure, racing/ pounding in chest was resolving; outcome of forceful beat feeling in her chest, UTI, potassium was a little low, felt really wiped out and worn down/tired, anxiety was unknown; outcome of arm a little bit sore, 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit fever was resolved on 28Dec2020.; Sender's Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.

A 35-year-old female patient received second single dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot number EK9231, expiration date Apr2021) intramuscularly on 12Jan2021 (between 8:30 to 9 am) at left deltoid for Covid-19 prevention. The first dose was received on Wednesday (unspecified date). Patient had no medical history and had no concomitant medications. At night of 12Jan2021, the patient had a fever of 102, but she went to bed with it and she woke up in the morning around 4:30 or 5 am (13Jan2021) in a pool of sweat, so she took her temperature and she was fever with 103.6. Patient took Motrin (Store Brand, lot number as either: 0GE2417A or OGE2417A, expiry: Apr2022) three 200 mg tablets, for a totally of 600 mg for the fever and had a cold shower, and the temperature came down to 103. Then after like 10-15 minutes of her laying on the couch with ice packs on her arms and stuff, it went down to 102.6. Patient was not going to go to the ER for just the fever, but then she started having heart palpitations, and she took her blood pressure and it was 170/113 and her heart rate was 176. Patient went to the hospital, and when they took her heart rate, it was 156. She had her blood taken at the hospital and everything was normal, except that her Potassium was a little low, it was 3. The ER did an EKG that showed Sinus Tachycardia and she was given IV Fluids (two boluses of 0.9% Normal Saline, 2000 mL total via IV, a bag of Potassium IV, two oral tablets of Potassium, unspecified total dose), and everything went back down. She had to call out from work that day and planed to follow up with her Primary Care Physician (PCP) in a couple of days. Patient was no longer had the fever, high blood pressure or high heart rate, as when she left the ER this morning, her temperature was 98, blood pressure was 111/82, and her heart rate was 96. She felt good now, but she did not know if it could happen again. Patient thought that it was maybe just her immune response to the vaccine, so she would say that she has recovered probably close to completely. Patient also had a headache and ringing in her ears, and those had resolved by now as well. The events Fever, Sinus tachycardia, Heart Palpitations, high blood pressure resolved on 13Jan2021 and other event resolved in Jan2021. The patient stated that the events (Fever, Sinus tachycardia, Heart Palpitations, high blood pressure) could have been serious with her blood pressure being so high, but it was not so serious because she did the right thing and went to the ER for treatment and got fluids. She believes the events (Fever, Sinus tachycardia, Heart Palpitations, high blood pressure) are medically significant. The patient believes that the events she experienced were directly caused by her receiving the vaccine, as she has never had these symptoms before other than she of course has had fevers in her life in the past.; Sender's Comments: A possible contribution role of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine) to the onset of the reported events cannot be excluded.

CT chest is notable for b/l GGOs along with some interstitial infiltrates with an upper and particularly mid zone and perihilar predominance, septal thickening and crazy paving, and numerous cystic lesions or pneumatoceles. There is a lack of lobar consolidation and pulmonary nodules. Of note, PET/CT about 2 months ago only demonstrated some mild to moderate emphysema mostly in the upper lobes. Therefore, there has been a relatively dramatic change in a few months, suggesting a more subacute process, rather than an acute infectious process such as a viral pneumonia, including COVID-19 infection, in which the GGOs tend to be subpleural and peripheral. Overall, our suspicion for COVID-19 is relatively low, with negative testing x2 yesterday, negative testing a few weeks ago, and lack of sick contacts, but it is possible. Therefore, higher on the differential is a more subacute infection or chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis. Risk factors include malignancy, chemotherapy, and use of steroids (equivalence of about 27 mg of Prednisone in the form of Dexamethasone since 11/6/20 without PJP prophylaxis). These risk factors, along with consistent imaging and elevated LDH, make PJP quite likely. Fungal infection is less likely based on imaging. Chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis is a possibility, especially given the more subacute picture based on imaging. Both Gemcitabine and Docetaxel can cause pneumonitis. However, the patient has been on steroids, which is used to treat drug-induced pneumonitis, although this does not exclude it completely."" 1/2/21: Transferred to ICU for worsening hypoxemia as patient reached 40L/100% FIO2 and remained on COVID isolation/COVID patient under investigation per ID recommendation. 1/4/21: Isolation precautions discontinued due to lower suspicion for active COVID infection to explain current presentation 1/6/21: Went into atrial fibrillation w/o RVR overnight 1/6. Tolerating, with MAPs in low 60s and HR in high 90s/low 100s. Suspect due to being-1L yesterday from diuresis, lasix stopped.

"" 1/7/21 Infectious Disease note: ""This is an immunocompromised host due to cancer on active chemotherapy (albeit ANC>4000 on admission) and notably had been on daily PO dexamethasone 1 mg TID (total daily dose 3 mg, equivalent to 20 mg PO prednisone) since 11/6/20 without any PJP ppx. There was elevated c/f COVID-19 infection in setting of patient's presenting symptoms, especially in conjunction with b/l GGOs on imaging. Has undergone multiple COVID test that have all resulted negative. Discussed radiographic findings with radiology colleagues, and overall, it is difficult to definitively narrow the differential with imaging alone, but overall density of GGOs seem to appear less likely PJP and more in line with chemical pneumonitis vs COVID, although less typical for viral pneumonia as well. Given false-negative COVID tests are not unheard of, especially in the immunocompromised population, patient was kept on isolation precautions as a PUI for abundance of caution. He is now off precautions. In setting of patient having been on prednisone for some time without PJP ppx, he was also started on treatment dose TMP/SMX. Beta-d-glucan has returned positive, and although not the ideal test for PJP, this can certainly support a potential dx of PJP. Unfortunately, DFA from sputum was not performed due to insufficient sample and currently the patient is unable to produce an additional sample for testing. He is tolerating the high-dose TMP/SMX; we adjusted the dose to three SS tablets TID based on his somewhat declining UOP. Other fungal etiologies are pending work-up as well. Lastly, patient's chemotherapy is known to cause pneumonitis, but per pulmonology team, he receives prophylactic dexamethasone with his chemo cycles that should help to prevent drug-induced pneumonitis. Remains on the differential for now and this should also be concurrently treated with the steroids he is receiving."" 1/10/21: Comfort care initiated. All non-comfort measures were discontinued.

Vaccine administered at hospital and not military facility. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Medical history included ongoing Graves' disease (the patient had her thyroid irradiated away for Grave's disease 25 years ago). Family Medical History was none. Concomitant medication included ongoing levothyroxine 1.25 mcg once daily by mouth Graves' disease taking for 25 years. Prior vaccination within 4 weeks was none. The patient received her Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 04Jan2021. Since then she started to experience a genital itch immediately; a rash that was across her body; eyes were swollen and itchy; new itchy rash 13Jan2021. She felt okay going home then she started to have itching around the genital area. She thought she might have a yeast infection but she didn't have any other symptoms for a yeast infection. Her vulva became swollen from 05Jan2021 and itchy from 04Jan2021 and she noticed rash around her body. It all started in the genital area. The next day the rash spread down her thighs and she noticed an itchy place on her face, but you couldn't see it. Her thighs were inflamed and she noticed patches of angry whelps on her hips as well as a itchy rash area on her tailbone that seemed more like shingles; size of a quarter; raised, itchy, rash, that felt like it was radiating out. Then she noticed the rash on her face on her cheek, general swelling on her eyes and itching on her eye lids. Now the genital itching was less and most of her symptoms were improved but her eye was driving her crazy and it was more swollen on the outside. She tried to treat her eyes with eye drops Dry Eye Relief (manufacturer Similasan; no UPC seen, lot number: 15942; expiration date: Sep2022, ingredients include Belladonna) but it didn't help. They were still itchy and weepy. The eye drops were not working. She also treated the rash and itching with Benadryl at night and it improved the symptoms overall. She took Tylenol (UPC 300043760; lot number: PMA003; expiration date: Aug2022) and Bayer Aspirin (81mg; lot number: NAA93E1; expiration date: Feb2023. No UPC code on bottle) every day for general arthritis symptoms, but they didn't touch her dull headache she has had on and off since the vaccine. Before she got the vaccine, she had a little tag on her vulva, it was tiny. Now after experiencing the itching, swelling, rash on her vulva, the tag was gone. It just took a layer of skin right off. It was not uncomfortable but the whole layer of the skin was gone. It was very uncomfortable while it was happening but now it was okay. When she noticed these symptoms, she tried to call occupational health and a institute but didn't get anyone. She also contacted her HCP but had not heard back. It seemed to her like a lot of side effects and a lot of itching. She didn't have it in her throat, but all that itching seems a lot like an anaphylactic reaction. She was curious whether we would recommend her to take the second dose since they say the reaction to the second dose was worse. She had multiple COVID tests that have all come back negative. A friend tested positive so she had a test; and she had a test when she traveled. The events did not require a visit to physician or emergency room.
